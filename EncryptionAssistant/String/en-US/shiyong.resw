    <value>Encryption/decryption keys: Using the default key encryption eliminates the need to enter the key yourself, but reduces some security. To prevent files from being maliciously decrypted by other apps, the default key is no longer explicitly displayed this time. Previously, due to our negligence, we are sorry that we did not take into account the malicious use of the default key attack by a technician. The number of digits required for each encryption algorithm is given, and in general dividing the number of digits by 8 is the length of the character you want to enter (we do not guarantee the consequences of Chinese) for example: 56 bits will be entered with 7 numbers or letters (for example: 123F56A) (to be exact hexadecimal, F after the letter as far as possible do not lose). If more or less than a given number of keys is detected, the app truncates from the back or uses empty characters to complement them.</value>

  <data name="textblock30.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Concept: MD5, message-Algorithm 5 (information-summary algorithm 5), to ensure complete and consistent information transmission. It is one of the most widely used algorithms of computers (and translation summary algorithms, hash algorithms), and MD5 has been widely implemented in mainstream programming languages. The operation of data (such as Chinese characters) as another fixed-length value is the basic principle of the hybrid algorithm, which was preceded by MD2, MD3 and MD4. The MD5 algorithm has the following features:</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock31.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1. Compression: any length of data, calculated MD5 value length is fixed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock32.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>2. Easy to calculate: It is easy to calculate the MD5 value from the original data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock33.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>3. Anti-modification: any changes to the original data, even if only 1 byte, the resulting MD5 value is very different.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock34.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>4. Strong collision: Known raw data and its MD5 value, it is very difficult to find a data with the same MD5 value (i.e. falsified data).</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock35.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The role of MD5 is to make large-capacity information compressed into a confidential format (i.e., converting a string of bytes of any length into a certain length of hexadecimal string) hash algorithm skewed it, before signing a private key with digital signature software. Due to the time constraints did not add the sha3 algorithm, here is a sincere apology to express.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock36.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Popular explanation: Many download sites will give the file's sha value, only need to compare the downloaded file's sha value is consistent with the given, you can determine whether the file is damaged during the download process</value>

    <value>Due to Microsoft's aggressive update policy and limited effort on the part of the development team, it is no longer possible to compile the 1.3.711 code project or run the 1.3.6 local installation package. But we built 1.3.711 version of the encryption/decryption page in the app How to access it: Help Center - archive</value>

    <value>Please convert all encrypted old versions of files into new format files as soon as possible, and we can only maintain support for older files within our capabilities. 1.5.23 version In order to be down-compatible with the operating system, the file encoding was changed from the default code to UTF-8, very few users who could not decrypt the prompt file corruption, please contact the developer for 1.5.21 beta</value>

    <value>Encryption algorithms (symmetric encryption)</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock8.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Concept: The basic process of data encryption is to process the original clear-text file or data according to some algorithm, making it unreadable a piece of code, often referred to as redaction, so that it can only be entered after the corresponding key can show the original content, through such a way to protect the data from illegal theft, reading purposes. The reverse process of the process is the process of decrypting, which converts the encoded information into its original data.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="textblock9.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Popular explanation: It's like putting your file in a drawer and locking it, only with the corresponding key to open it (decrypted), and no one else can open it unless it's violent (try ingestalling all the keys in the world)</value>

  </data>
  <data name="textblock48.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This part is still under development, the function is very simple, please also use the user's mentality of testing. We plan to update the magnetic link and seed file download function next year. I hope that you can get some guidance in this area and speed up our pace. If you don't want the app to be networked, you can refuse to apply network permissions in the system settings. Thank you for your support.</value>
